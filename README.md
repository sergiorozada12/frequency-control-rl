# frequency-control-rl
This repository relates to the MSc Data Science's dissertation called "Frequency control in unbalanced distribution systems" conducted at City, University of London. It aims to model the hierarchy of control of a power distribution problem by using Reinforcement Learning techniques.

This repository contains all the algorithms, test files, models, results and auxiliary files used in the development of the project. These files contain all the information needed to replicate and test the experiments and simulations described in the project report. TensorFlow models are stored in models folder while data contains .pickle files with training results. Each algorithm is stored in its own python script while some auxiliary files define the dynamics of the environment.

Although the code have been developed for the purpose of this project, some snippets has been taken from different authors:
